# Day 03 – Linux Commands Practice

## Task
Today’s goal is to **build your Linux command confidence**.

You will create a cheat sheet of commands focused on:
- Process management
- File system
- Networking troubleshooting

This is the command toolkit you will reuse for years.

---

## Expected Output
By the end of today, you should have:

- A markdown file named:  
  `linux-commands-cheatsheet.md`

or

- A hand written cheat sheet (Recommended)

Your cheat sheet should be easy to scan during real troubleshooting.

---

## Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your cheat sheet:

- Include **at least 20 commands** with one‑line usage notes
- Add **3 networking commands** (`ping`, `ip addr`, `dig`, `curl`, etc.)
- Group commands by category
- Keep it concise and readable

---

## Resources
You may refer to:

- Linux `man` pages
- Your class notes
- Reliable Linux command references

Don’t copy long lists. Focus on commands you understand.

---

## Why This Matters for DevOps
Real production issues are solved at the command line.

The faster you can inspect logs and network issues, the faster you can:
- Restore service
- Reduce downtime
- Gain trust as an operator
