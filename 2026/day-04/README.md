# Day 04 – Linux Practice: Processes and Services

## Task
Today’s goal is to **practice Linux fundamentals with real commands**.

You will create a short practice note by actually running basic commands and capturing what you see:
- Check running processes
- Inspect one systemd service
- Capture a small troubleshooting flow

This is hands-on. Keep it simple and focused on fundamentals.

---

## Expected Output
By the end of today, you should have:

- A markdown file named:  
  `linux-practice.md`

or

- A hand written practice log (Recommended)

Your note should show what you actually ran on your system.

---

## Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your practice note:

- Run and record output for **at least 6 commands**
- Include **2 process commands** (`ps`, `top`, `pgrep`, etc.)
- Include **2 service commands** (`systemctl status`, `systemctl list-units`, etc.)
- Include **2 log commands** (`journalctl -u <service>`, `tail -n 50`, etc.)
- Pick **one service on your system** (example: `ssh`, `cron`, `docker`) and inspect it
- Keep it **simple and actionable**

Suggested structure for `linux-practice.md`:
- Process checks
- Service checks
- Log checks
- Mini troubleshooting steps

---

## Resources
You may refer to:

- Your notes from Day 02 and Day 03
- Linux `man` pages
- Your class notes

## Why This Matters for DevOps
Hands‑on practice builds speed and confidence.

When issues happen in production, you won’t have time to search for basic commands.  
This day helps you build muscle memory with Linux fundamentals.
