# Day 02 – Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd

## Task
Today’s goal is to **understand how Linux works under the hood**.

You will create a short note that explains:
- The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)
- How processes are created and managed
- What systemd does and why it matters

This is the foundation for all troubleshooting you will do as a DevOps engineer.

---

## Expected Output
By the end of today, you should have:

- A markdown file named:  
  `linux-architecture-notes.md`

or

- A hand written set of notes (Recommended)

Your notes should be clear enough that someone new to Linux can follow them.

---

## Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your notes:

- Explain **process states** (running, sleeping, zombie, etc.)
- List **5 commands** you would use daily
- Keep it **short and practical** (under 1 page)
- Use bullet points and short headings

---

## Resources
You may refer to:

- Linux `man` pages (`ps`, `top`, `systemctl`)
- Official systemd docs
- Your class notes

Avoid copying/pasting AI Generated content.
Focus on understanding.

---

## Why This Matters for DevOps
Linux is the base OS for almost every production system.

If you know how processes and systemd work, you can:
- Debug crashed services faster
- Fix CPU/memory issues
- Understand logs and service restarts confidently

This knowledge saves hours during incidents.

## Submission
1. Fork this `90DaysOfDevOps` repository  
2. Navigate to the `2026/day-02/` folder  
3. Add your `linux-architecture-notes.md` file  
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork
